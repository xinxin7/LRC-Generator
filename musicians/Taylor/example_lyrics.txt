City lights flicker like old home movies,
Neon dreams on a cracked-screen sky.
People rush past me, faces like echoes,
But I’m standing still in the middle of time.

Oh, the taxis blur like golden streaks,
A thousand footsteps, but none for me.
I'm stuck between the past and tomorrow,
Waiting for something to set me free.

I’m caught in the motion, midnight in my veins,
The world keeps spinning, but I stay the same.
Heart like a record, skipping on your name,
Tell me, do you feel it, or am I alone in the rain?

Every street feels like déjà vu,
Same old coffee shop, table for two.
But your chair’s empty, your voice is missing,
And I’m lost in a memory I can’t undo.

Oh, the sirens hum a melody,
A symphony of what used to be.
I watch my shadow in the window’s glow,
Wondering if you’re out there, searching for me.

I’m caught in the motion, midnight in my veins,
The world keeps spinning, but I stay the same.
Heart like a record, skipping on your name,
Tell me, do you feel it, or am I alone in the rain?

I whisper to the skyline, but it never answers back,
I reach for the past, but it fades into black.
Maybe love was a streetlight flickering out,
Or maybe I’m just learning what life’s all about.

I’m caught in the motion, midnight in my veins,
The world keeps spinning, but I stay the same.
Heart like a record, skipping on your name,
Tell me, do you feel it, or am I alone in the rain?

Standing still in a world that won’t wait,
Between yesterday and a runaway fate.
If I let go, will the stars realign?
Or am I just another lost light in the night?
